# Instead

*The Safari Extension that slaps you on the wrist every time you walk off the productivity path.*

It knows when you open one of your favourite productivity-draining sites. It has JavaScript powers. And it opens something better instead - your favourite productivity-inducing app. Things.

Use the settings to add a blacklist. I don't need to tell you what goes on there. You know it already. It's ingrained into your muscle memory. With enough un-practise, maybe your fingers will forget.

Download it on the [releases page](https://github.com/cormacrelf/instead/releases).
